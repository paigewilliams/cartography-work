# cartography-work

Here are some samples of my cartographic work. 

### Brochures

These maps are part of a series of brochures to be distributed at Oregon Metropolitan Planning Organization Consortiums. The layout and graphics were produced by Yana Stannik and I produced the maps. These were created during my internship with Metro.

### Food Security

This map was created for the California Center for Rural Policy (CCRP) to visualize the population demographics that the local food pantries serves. Using data from the US Census Bureau and survey results collected by the CCRP, the viewer can see what kinds of people are living with different levels of food security. This was created for a cartography practicum course at Humboldt State University.
